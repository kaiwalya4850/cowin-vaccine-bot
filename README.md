# Cowin Bot

My own bot on telegram is live by this username: @CoWINchecker_bot


A telegram bot that shows a number of available vaccines in vaccination centers near you. 

This takes Age and Postal Code as input from the user. Based on this, you'll get all the vaccination center names and available vaccines. 

Sometimes, there are some issues with the API they've provided so, it stops working.

This is how the output looks like:

``
Here are all vaccination centers and vaccine count corresponding to the postal code you mentioned: [{'Maa Bharti School 18 To45': 0}, {'HCG ONCOLOGY SUNFARMA ROAD': 0}, {'Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh18to45': 0}, {'HCG ONCOLOGY SUNFARMA ROAD': 0}, {'Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh18to45': 0}, 'No available slots on: 07-05-2021', 'No available slots on: 08-05-2021', 'No available slots on: 09-05-2021', 'No available slots on: 10-05-2021', 'No available slots on: 11-05-2021']
``


## Usage
Open Telegram, go to Botfather, and get a token.

Replace this token with "TOKEN" in the code.

Run it like
```python
python bot.py
```

## Future updates
Finding a way to so that API works all the time

Adding functionality that will send a message to the user, every 30 mins, about the availability of vaccines. 

Deployment on Heroku

Until then... Stay home, stay safe!
